# credit-card-fraud
This is a machine learning project using python for credit card fraud detection while transaction.The dataset used in this is from a kaggle.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a very small percentage of fraudulent transactions compared to normal ones. To tackle this challenge, data preprocessing, feature scaling, and resampling methods are applied.
