# credit-card-fraud
This is a machine learning project using python for credit card fraud detection while transaction.The dataset used in this is from a kaggle.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a very small percentage of fraudulent transactions compared to normal ones. To tackle this challenge, data preprocessing, feature scaling, and resampling methods are applied.

Key Features
Data preprocessing (handling imbalance with SMOTE/undersampling)
Feature scaling and normalization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for fraud vs non-fraud patterns

Implementation of multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree / Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks (optional)
Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
Focus on reducing false negatives (catching more frauds)

 Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
Google Colab
